The directory contains results from the experiments. 

Folder name specifies the experiment name for which the results it contains. And the misc folder contains the results from test runs of custom created traces. 

Note: These are raw results from the miner. Manual processing needs to be done in order to infer the proper results (proper results here refers to results containing only the non-trivial formulas).
